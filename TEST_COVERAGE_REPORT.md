- ✅ Error handling and edge cases
- ✅ Concurrent operations
- ✅ State consistency
- ✅ Performance under load

## 🚨 Current Issues Identified

During test implementation, several issues were discovered in the main library:

### Compilation Errors
1. **Missing Type Definitions**: Several types are not properly exported
   - `CartTotals`, `ShippingMethod`, `OrderListResponse`
   - `CheckoutSession`, `PaymentMethod`, etc.

2. **Model Conflicts**: Duplicate model definitions
   - Multiple `Cart` classes in different files
   - Address type conflicts between models

3. **API Inconsistencies**: Method signature mismatches
   - Return type mismatches between API and plugin layers
   - Missing required parameters

4. **Dependency Issues**: Package compatibility problems
   - Connectivity package API changes
   - Network service initialization issues
